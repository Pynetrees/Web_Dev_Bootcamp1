      No. We're on the top. I saw you with those two <span>"ladies
      of the evening"</span> at Elzars. Explain that. I am the man
      with no name, Zapp Brannigan! No! The kind with
      looting and maybe starting a few fires! Goodbye, cruel
      world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet
      drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort
      of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain
      pull cords. Cruel though they may beâ€¦ But existing is
      basically all I do! Soon enough. Fry, we have a crate
      to deliver. Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the
      streets!
